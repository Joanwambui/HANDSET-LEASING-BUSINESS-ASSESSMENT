# HANDSET-LEASING-BUSINESS-ASSESSMENT
Determining the viability of phone leasing for company X(telecom company) in order to increase client retention, which is beneficial to the company.
# INTRODUCTION
Local telecom company,Company X, has seen a drop in profits in recent years. The corporation develops a theory for the introduction of handset leasing in an effort to cut losses to a minimum and help with customer retention.Instead of selling phones to clients at a reduced upfront cost, handset leasing operates by renting new phones to users for a monthly price. Prior to exchanging their used phone for a new model, customers lease phones for a set period of time (often 12 months). Some telecommunications providers pair sim-only mobile plans at a discount with phone leasing programs. Customers will be able to switch phones more regularly as a result without having to pay the upfront charges associated with retail phone purchases or having their mobile plans affected. This lessens the telecoms' need to keep inventory and lowers their financing expenses, both of which can increase profitability.The team decides to investigate the possibility of handset leasing for Company X because comparably developed countries like Singapore, the US, and Australia have successfully introduced the concept.
I consider how the handset leasing company has affected other markets in order to gauge how it would affect the client's financials. I conduct background research on any upcoming financial phrases I could need before beginning any data analysis as follows:

# FINANCIAL_DATASET OVERVIEW
I use Excel to conduct my analysis on some financial data. For our dataset, there are two businesses that closely resemble Company X's domestic market. An efficient duopoly is formed by the two major players. Two years ago, Company A introduced handset leasing, but Company B did not. We can now separate the effect of handset leasing on profitability from the information provided.
Take a look at the financial information we'll be using:

# DATA ANALYSIS-MODELLING
Task1-In order to establish how leasing mobile devices affects financial performance, I will perform data analysis for Companies A and B. As a result, I will apply my own assumptions and determine the measures that would be used to do a financial prediction for Company X.
Task2-Then, using the identified measures and performance consequences, I will anticipate an increase in Company X's key KPIs. To accomplish this, first assume Company X will expand at the industry average rate, then assume it will grow at the same rate as Company A, which started leasing. We can determine the net impact of leasing by comparing the two forecasts.
To find the incremental impact of introducing handset leasing I will conduct the following steps with illustrations to follow:

Step 1:The most crucial parameters would need to be determined.

Step 2:I would need to apply industry average growth rates for the pertinent indicators (Company B) for Company X in order to estimate no leasing case.

Step 3:I would use Company A growth cases to estimate the lease case.

Step 4:I would make logical estimates for all other figures, using historical data

Step 5:I would calculate the impact of handset leasing for Company X

We will first calculate the percentage growth of the industry Average:

Then we would calculate the Growth percent![](Images/Screenshot%20(269).png)age for both Company A and Company B separately:

Now we would find the Net Profit Growth ARPU for the Indusrty Average:
