# HANDSET-LEASING-BUSINESS-ASSESSMENT
Determining the viability of phone leasing for company X(telecom company) in order to increase client retention, which is beneficial to the company.
# INTRODUCTION
Local telecom company,Company X, has seen a drop in profits in recent years. The corporation develops a theory for the introduction of handset leasing in an effort to cut losses to a minimum and help with customer retention.Instead of selling phones to clients at a reduced upfront cost, handset leasing operates by renting new phones to users for a monthly price. Prior to exchanging their used phone for a new model, customers lease phones for a set period of time (often 12 months). Some telecommunications providers pair sim-only mobile plans at a discount with phone leasing programs. Customers will be able to switch phones more regularly as a result without having to pay the upfront charges associated with retail phone purchases or having their mobile plans affected. This lessens the telecoms' need to keep inventory and lowers their financing expenses, both of which can increase profitability.The team decides to investigate the possibility of handset leasing for Company X because comparably developed countries like Singapore, the US, and Australia have successfully introduced the concept.
I consider how the handset leasing company has affected other markets in order to gauge how it would affect the client's financials. I conduct background research on any upcoming financial phrases I could need before beginning any data analysis as follows:
